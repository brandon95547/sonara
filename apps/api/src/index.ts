/**
 * Process entry point. Everything testable lives in `buildApp`; this file owns

 * down without dropping a request.
 */

/**
 * How long a graceful shutdown gets before the process leaves anyway.
 *
 * A close that never resolves is worse than an abrupt exit. The process stays
 * alive holding the listening socket, so the *next* start dies with
 * EADDRINUSE — and what the operator sees is not "shutdown is slow" but "the
 * API will not come back up", which sends them looking in entirely the wrong
 * place. In development the same thing happens every time a watcher restarts
 * the server; in production it is a container that has to be SIGKILLed.
 *
 * Five seconds is long enough for any request this API serves to finish and
 * short enough to stay under a typical orchestrator's kill grace period.
